<h2>About</h2>
<p>Read more about the project...</p>
<h3><b>Project Goal</b></h3>
<p>The goal of the project is to expand church-based health promotion activities. In this project, 
we have partnered with the Black Ministerial Alliance (BMA) in Boston and church members to co-design 
a smartphone application. By working with church members, we hope to create an application that reflects the priorities and values of their church community.</p>

<h3><b>Next Steps</b></h3>

<p>As we build the app, we hope to include more churches throughout the Boston area. Our goal is to find ways to improve the health of the
laity of the Black Ministerial Alliance (BMA) in Boston. Our next steps include building and testing app prototypes. We plan to build a
  series of app prototypes to be tested by members of your church community.</p>

The prototypes will support spiritual practice through:
- **Prayer Wall**
- **Pastor Messages**
- **Scriptural Meditations**

The prototypes will focus on the following health topics:
- Physical Activity - including encouragement for walking.
- Nutrition - starting with fruits and vegetables and healthy hydration.
- Wellness - including stress management, depression, and meditation.
- Healthy Relationships - addressing interpersonal violence and how our relationships impact our health.
