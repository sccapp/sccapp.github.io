## Summary of the Work in Year 1 

##### **Project Goal:**
The goal of the project is to expand church-based health promotion activities. We partnered with the Black Ministerial Alliance (BMA) 
in Boston and church members to co-design a smartphone application. By working with church members, we hope to create an application that 
reflects the priorities and values of their church community. 

##### Members from the two churches have participated in:


##### **9** different types of sessions to design the app.
##### **40** total focus groups and interviews.

##### For a total of **62** hours on the project so far.

##### *Thank you so much for all your hard work this past year, and for sharing your experiences and insights with us!*

## **Takeaways:**

With the help of church members, we identified four health topics: 

**Physical Activity, Nutrition, Stress and Mental Health, and Healthy Relationships.** 

We learned from church members that it is important that the application: 

- Promote in-person interactions and increase communication between church members.
- Support the userâ€™s faith practices. 
- Reflect the diversity of the church communities. 

## **Next Steps:**

- **Building app prototypes.** We plan to build a series of app prototypes to be tested by members of your church community. 
- **Collaborating with Church Leaders.** 
- **Recruiting more Churches.**
