## **Getting Started**

#### **Getting access to the app**

Contact Dhaval Parmar either via Slack or email <dhavalparmar@northeastern.edu> to get access. You will need to provide your Google ID (for Android) 
or Apple ID (for iOS) to be added as a tester.

*Please let Dhaval know which phone make/model you are using to test the app or add yourself to this document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hu2XE6cPSM1YHxyi2hRoknW_9eZPqcXMEk7_ImjYQZs/edit#gid=0).**

###### **iPhone**
Once you have been added as a testor, you will receive an invitation to download and install the app via email, with the subject
