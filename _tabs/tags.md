## **Getting Started**

#### **Getting access to the app**

Contact Dhaval Parmar either via Slack or email to get access. You will need to provide your Google ID (for Android) 
or Apple ID (for iOS) to be added as a tester.

*Please let Dhaval know which phone make/model you are using to test the app or add yourself to this document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hu2XE6cPSM1YHxyi2hRoknW_9eZPqcXMEk7_ImjYQZs/edit#gid=0).*

#### **Downloading the test app**

Once you have been added as a testor, you may go to the following link to download and install the app: <https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4700153961691507100> 

###### **iPhone**
Once you have been added as a testor, you will receive an invitation to download and install the app via email, with the subject 
"Evelyne Kimani has invited you to test the SCC Church Connect app".
Apps that are in the testing stage are installed through another app called TestFlight. The invitation email will have an
access code which you will need to enter into TestFlight.
