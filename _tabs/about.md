### **Project Goal**
The goal of the project is to expand church-based health promotion activities. In this project,  
we have partnered with the Black Ministerial Alliance (BMA) in Boston and church members to co-design  
a smartphone application. By working with church members, we hope to create an application that reflects the priorities and values of their church community.   

> **Note**: Add Markdown syntax content to file `_tabs/about.md` and it will show up on this page yea.
